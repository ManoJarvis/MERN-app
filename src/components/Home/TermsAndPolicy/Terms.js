8. Rules for delivery:<br/>

If recipient doesn’t accept the delivery, we shall consider the order to be delivered.<br/>

Occasionally, substitutions of flowers or containers are necessary due to temporary, regional availability issues.

We however reserve the right to substitute the flowers (Including specified color) / other products with equal or higher value in case of non availability of the desired product.<br/>

12. Rules for unfounded recipient:

In case the final customer is not available for receiving the placed order and we have strict instructions to deliver only to the intended customer the order shall be considered as delivered and no refund will be made. Please refer Cancellation and refund policy for further details.<br/>
